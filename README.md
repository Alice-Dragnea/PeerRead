# PeerReaD
Data and code for Kang et al., 2018's paper titled "A Dataset of Peer Reviews (PeerReaD): Collection, Insights and NLP Applications"

# TODOs
* Add a script for downloading the nips papers 2013-2017 (PDFs and reviews), splitting them similarly to the paper, as described [here](./data/nips_2013-2016/README.md)
* Copy arxiv papers from each split in the old repo to one or more subdirectories in `data/arxiv.cs.ai_2007-2017/{train|dev|test}`.
