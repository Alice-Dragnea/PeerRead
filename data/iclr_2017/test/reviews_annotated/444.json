{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Automatic Rule Extraction from Long Short Term Memory Networks", "abstract": "Although deep learning models have proven effective at solving problems in natural language processing, the mechanism by which they come to their conclusions is often unclear.   As a result, these models are generally treated as black boxes, yielding no insight of the underlying learned patterns.  In this paper we consider Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and demonstrate a new approach for tracking the importance of a given input to the LSTM for a given output. By identifying consistently important patterns of words, we are able to distill state of the art LSTMs on sentiment analysis and question answering into a set of representative phrases. This representation is then quantitatively validated by using the extracted phrases to construct a simple, rule-based classifier which approximates the output of the LSTM.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": false, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This work proposes a pattern extraction method to both understand what a trained LSTM has learnt and to allow implementation of a hand-coded algorithm that performs similarly to the LSTM.
