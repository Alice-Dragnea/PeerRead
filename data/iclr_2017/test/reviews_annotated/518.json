{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Learning to Draw Samples: With Application to Amortized MLE for Generative Adversarial Learning", "abstract": "We propose a simple algorithm to train stochastic neural networks to draw samples from given target distributions for probabilistic inference. Our method is based on iteratively adjusting the neural network parameters so that the output changes along a Stein variational gradient that maximumly decreases the KL divergence with the target distribution. Our method works for any target distribution specified by their unnormalized density function, and can train any black-box architectures that are differentiable in terms of the parameters we want to adapt. As an application of our method, we propose an amortized MLE algorithm for training deep energy model, where a neural sampler is adaptively trained to approximate the likelihood function. Our method mimics an adversarial game between the deep energy model and the neural sampler, and obtains realistic-looking images competitive with the state-of-the-art results.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 3, "SUBSTANCE": 2, "comments": "The authors propose amortized SVGD, an amortized form of prior work on SVGD, which is a particle variational method that maximally decreases the KL divergence at each update. \"amortized SVGD\" is done ", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": 2, "is_meta_review": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 1, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"SUBSTANCE": 3, "comments": "This paper considers the energy-based model interpretation of GAN, where the discriminator is an unnormalized model for the likelihood of a generative model p(x|theta) and the generator is a directed ", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": 3, "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "CLARITY": 3, "is_meta_review": false}, {"IS_META_REVIEW": false, "SUBSTANCE": 3, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper proposes an amortized version of the Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) method in which \"a neural network is trained to mimic the SVGD dynamics\".
