{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Unsupervised Learning of State Representations for Multiple Tasks", "abstract": "We present an approach for learning state representations in multi-task reinforcement learning. Our method learns multiple low-dimensional state representations from raw observations in an unsupervised fashion, without any knowledge of which task is executed, nor of the number of tasks involved. The method is based on a gated neural network architecture, trained with an extension of the learning with robotic priors objective. In simulated experiments, we show that our method is able to learn better state representations for reinforcement learning, and we analyze why and when it manages to do so.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 4, "ORIGINALITY": 4, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper builds upon the method of Jonschkowski & Brock to learn state representations for multiple tasks, rather than a single task.
