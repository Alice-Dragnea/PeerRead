{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Gaussian Attention Model and Its Application to Knowledge Base Embedding and Question Answering", "abstract": "We propose the Gaussian attention model for content-based neural memory access. With the proposed attention model, a neural network has the additional degree of freedom to control the focus of its attention from a laser sharp attention to a broad attention. It is applicable whenever we can assume that the distance in the latent space reflects some notion of semantics. We use the proposed attention model as a scoring function for the embedding of a knowledge base into a continuous vector space and then train a model that performs question answering about the entities in the knowledge base. The proposed attention model can handle both the propagation of uncertainty when following a series of relations and also the conjunction of conditions in a natural way. On a dataset of soccer players who participated in the FIFA World Cup 2014, we demonstrate that our model can handle both path queries and conjunctive queries well.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"SUBSTANCE": 5, "comments": "This paper presents extensions to previous work using embeddings for modeling Knowledge Bases and performing Q&A on them, centered around the use of multivariate gaussian likelihood instead of inner p", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": 3, "ORIGINALITY": 3, "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "is_meta_review": false}, {"SUBSTANCE": 3, "comments": "SUMMARY.
