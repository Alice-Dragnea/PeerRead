Our framework combines the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approach (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) model) with curriculum learning. Our model is simple in design and only uses game states from the AI side, rather than using opponents' information. On a known map, our agent won 10 out of the 11 attended games and the champion of Track1 in ViZDoom AI Competition 2016 by a large margin, 35\\% higher score than the second place.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 3, "SUBSTANCE": 4, "comments": "This paper basically applies A3C to 3D spatial navigation tasks. - This is not the first time A3C has been applied to 3D navigation.
