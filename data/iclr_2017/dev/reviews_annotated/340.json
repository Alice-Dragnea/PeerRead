{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Unsupervised Cross-Domain Image Generation", "abstract": "We study the problem of transferring a sample in one domain to an analog sample in another domain. Given two related domains, S and T, we would like to learn a generative function G that maps an input sample from S to the domain T, such that the output of a given representation function f, which accepts inputs in either domains, would remain unchanged. Other than f, the training data is unsupervised and consist of a set of samples from each domain, without any mapping between them. The Domain Transfer Network (DTN) we present employs a compound loss function that includes a multiclass GAN loss, an f preserving component, and a regularizing component that encourages G to map samples from T to themselves. We apply our method to visual domains including digits and face images and demonstrate its ability to generate convincing novel images of previously unseen entities, while preserving their identity.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"SUBSTANCE": 5, "CLARITY": 5, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "Update: thank you for running more experiments, and add more explanations in the manuscript.
