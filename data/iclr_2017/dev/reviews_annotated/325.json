{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Learning to Generate Samples from Noise through Infusion Training", "abstract": "In this work, we investigate a novel training procedure to learn a generative model as the transition operator of a Markov chain, such that, when applied repeatedly on an unstructured random noise sample, it will denoise it into a sample that matches the target distribution from the training set. The novel training procedure to learn this progressive denoising operation involves sampling from a slightly different chain than the model chain used for generation in the absence of a denoising target. In the training chain we infuse information from the training target example that we would like the chains to reach with a high probability. The thus learned transition operator is able to produce quality and varied samples in a small number of steps. Experiments show competitive results compared to the samples generated with a basic Generative Adversarial Net.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": false, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "Summary: This paper introduces a heuristic approach for training a deep directed generative model, where similar to the transition operator of a Markov chain each layer samples from the same condition", "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": 4}, {"IS_META_REVIEW": false, "CLARITY": 5, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper presents a method for training a generative model via an iterative denoising procedure.
