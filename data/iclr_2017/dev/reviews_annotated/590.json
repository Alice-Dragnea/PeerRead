{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "End-to-End Answer Chunk Extraction and Ranking for Reading Comprehension", "abstract": "This paper proposes dynamic chunk reader (DCR), an end-to-end neural reading comprehension (RC) model that is able to extract and rank a set of answer candidates from a given document to answer questions. DCR is able to predict answers of variable lengths, whereas previous neural RC models primarily focused on predicting single tokens or entities. DCR encodes a document and an input question with recurrent neural networks, and then applies a word-by-word attention mechanism to acquire question-aware representations for the document, followed by the generation of chunk representations and a ranking module to propose the top-ranked chunk as the answer. Experimental results show that DCR could achieve a 66.3% Exact match and 74.7% F1 score on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"ORIGINALITY": 4, "CLARITY": 4, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "SYNOPSIS: The paper proposes a new neural network-based model for reading comprehension (reading a passage of text and answering questions based on the passage).
