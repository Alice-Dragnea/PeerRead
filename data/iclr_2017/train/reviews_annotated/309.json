{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Reinforcement Learning with Unsupervised Auxiliary Tasks", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning agents have achieved state-of-the-art results by directly maximising cumulative reward. However, environments contain a much wider variety of possible training signals. In this paper, we introduce an agent that also maximises many other pseudo-reward functions simultaneously by reinforcement learning. All of these tasks share a common representation that, like unsupervised learning, continues to develop in the absence of extrinsic rewards. We also introduce a novel mechanism for focusing this representation upon extrinsic rewards, so that learning can rapidly adapt to the most relevant aspects of the actual task. Our agent significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on Atari, averaging 880\\% expert human performance, and a challenging suite of first-person, three-dimensional \\emph{Labyrinth} tasks leading to a mean speedup in learning of 10$\\times$ and averaging 87\\% expert human performance on Labyrinth.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": false, "CLARITY": 5, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper proposes a way of adding unsupervised auxiliary tasks to a deep RL agent like A3C.
