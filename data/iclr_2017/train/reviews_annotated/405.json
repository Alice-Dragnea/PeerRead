{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Recurrent Environment Simulators", "abstract": "Models that can simulate how environments change in response to actions can be used by agents to plan and act efficiently. We improve on previous environment simulators from high-dimensional pixel observations by introducing recurrent neural networks that are able to make temporally and spatially coherent predictions for hundreds of time-steps into the future. We present an in-depth analysis of the factors affecting performance, providing the most extensive attempt to advance the understanding of the properties of these models. We address the issue of computationally inefficiency with a model that does not need to generate a high-dimensional image at each time-step. We show that our approach can be used to improve exploration and is adaptable to many diverse environments, namely 10 Atari games, a 3D car racing environment, and complex 3D mazes.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 3, "ORIGINALITY": 2, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper presents an action-conditional recurrent network that can predict frames in video games hundreds of steps in the future.
