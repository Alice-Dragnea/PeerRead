{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Learning Features of Music From Scratch", "abstract": "This paper introduces a new large-scale music dataset, MusicNet, to serve as a source  of supervision and evaluation of machine learning methods for music research.  MusicNet consists of hundreds of freely-licensed classical music recordings  by 10 composers, written for 11 instruments, together with instrument/note  annotations resulting in over 1 million temporal labels on 34 hours of chamber music performances under various studio and microphone conditions.   The paper defines a multi-label classification task to predict notes in musical recordings,  along with an evaluation protocol, and benchmarks several machine learning architectures for this task:  i) learning from spectrogram features;  ii) end-to-end learning with a neural net;  iii) end-to-end learning with a convolutional neural net.  These experiments show that end-to-end models trained for note prediction learn frequency selective filters as a low-level representation of audio.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"ORIGINALITY": 4, "CLARITY": 4, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper describes the creation of a corpus of freely-licensed classical music recordings along with corresponding MIDI-scores aligned to the audio.
