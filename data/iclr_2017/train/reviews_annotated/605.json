{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Tree-Structured Variational Autoencoder", "abstract": "Many kinds of variable-sized data we would like to model contain an internal hierarchical structure in the form of a tree, including source code, formal logical statements, and natural language sentences with parse trees. For such data it is natural to consider a model with matching computational structure. In this work, we introduce a variational autoencoder-based generative model for tree-structured data. We evaluate our model on a synthetic dataset, and a dataset with applications to automated theorem proving. By learning a latent representation over trees, our model can achieve similar test log likelihood to a standard autoregressive decoder, but with the number of sequentially dependent computations proportional to the depth of the tree instead of the number of nodes in the tree.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"SUBSTANCE": 3, "comments": "The method overall seems to be a very interesting structural approach to variational autoencoders, however it seems to lack motivation as well as the application areas sufficient to prove its effectiv", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": 3, "ORIGINALITY": 4, "is_meta_review": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 3, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"IMPACT": 2, "SUBSTANCE": 3, "comments": "The authors propose a variational autoencoder for a specific form of tree-generating model.
