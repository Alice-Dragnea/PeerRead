{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning", "abstract": "A recent approach to few-shot classification called matching networks has demonstrated the benefits of coupling metric learning with a training procedure that mimics test. This approach relies on a complicated fine-tuning procedure and an attention scheme that forms a distribution over all points in the support set, scaling poorly with its size. We propose a more streamlined approach, prototypical networks, that learns a metric space in which few-shot classification can be performed by computing Euclidean distances to prototype representations of each class, rather than individual points. Our method is competitive with state-of-the-art one-shot classification approaches while being much simpler and more scalable with the size of the support set. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our approach on the Omniglot and mini-ImageNet datasets. We further demonstrate that a similar idea can be used for zero-shot learning, where each class is described by a set of attributes, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the Caltech UCSD bird dataset.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": false, "CLARITY": 5, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "*** Paper Summary *** This paper simplify matching network by considering only a single prototype per class which is obtained as the average of the embedding of the training class samples.
