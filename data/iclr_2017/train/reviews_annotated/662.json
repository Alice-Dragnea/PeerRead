{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Dynamic Neural Turing Machine with Continuous and Discrete Addressing Schemes", "abstract": "In this paper, we extend neural Turing machine (NTM) into a dynamic neural Turing machine (D-NTM) by introducing a trainable memory addressing scheme. This addressing scheme maintains for each memory cell two separate vectors, content and address vectors. This allows the D-NTM to learn a wide variety of location-based addressing strategies including both linear and nonlinear ones. We implement the D-NTM with both continuous, differentiable and discrete, non-differentiable read/write mechanisms. We investigate the mechanisms and effects for learning to read and  write to a memory through experiments on Facebook bAbI tasks using both a feedforward and GRU-controller. The D-NTM is evaluated on a set of Facebook bAbI tasks and shown to outperform NTM and LSTM baselines. We also provide further experimental results on sequential MNIST, associative recall and copy tasks.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": 4, "comments": "This paper introduces a variant of the neural Turing machine (NTM, Graves et al. 2014) where key and values are stored.
