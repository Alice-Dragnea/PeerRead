{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Training Group Orthogonal Neural Networks with Privileged Information", "abstract": "Learning rich and diverse feature representation are always desired for deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Besides, when auxiliary annotations are available for specific data, simply ignoring them would be a great waste. In this paper, we incorporate these auxiliary annotations as privileged information and propose a novel CNN  model that is able to maximize inherent diversity of a CNN model such that the model can learn better feature representation with a stronger generalization ability. More specifically, we propose a group orthogonal convolutional neural network (GoCNN) to learn features from foreground and background in an orthogonal way by exploiting privileged information for optimization, which automatically emphasizes feature diversity within a single model. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, ImageNet and PASCAL VOC, well demonstrate the effectiveness and high generalization ability of our proposed GoCNN models.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"SUBSTANCE": 3, "comments": "This paper proposes a modification to ConvNet training so that the feature activations before the linear classifier are divided into groups such that all pairs of features across all pairs of groups a", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 3, "CLARITY": 5, "is_meta_review": false}, {"ORIGINALITY": 3, "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The starting point of this work is the understanding that by having decorrelated neurons (e.g. neurons that only fire on background, or only on foreground regions) one provides independent pieces of i", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": 5}, {"ORIGINALITY": 5, "CLARITY": 3, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper proposes to learn groups of orthogonal features in a convnet by penalizing correlation among features in each group.
