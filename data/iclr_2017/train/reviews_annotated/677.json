{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Skip-graph: Learning graph embeddings with an encoder-decoder model", "abstract": "In this work, we study the problem of feature representation learning for graph-structured data. Many of the existing work in the area are task-specific and based on supervised techniques. We study a method for obtaining a generic feature representation for a graph using an unsupervised approach. The neural encoder-decoder model is a method that has been used in the natural language processing domain to learn feature representations of sentences. In our proposed approach, we train the encoder-decoder model to predict the random walk sequence of neighboring regions in a graph given a random walk along a particular region. The goal is to map subgraphs \u2014 as represented by their random walks \u2014 that are structurally and functionally similar to nearby locations in feature space. We evaluate the learned graph vectors using several real-world datasets on the graph classification task. The proposed model is able to achieve good results against state-of- the-art techniques.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 3, "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": 4, "comments": "This paper studies the graph embedding problem by using the encoder-decoder method.
