{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Gated Multimodal Units for Information Fusion", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel model for multimodal learning based on gated neural networks. The Gated Multimodal Unit (GMU) model is intended to be used as an internal unit in a neural network architecture whose purpose is to find an intermediate representation based on a combination of data from different modalities. The GMU learns to decide how modalities influence the activation of the unit using multiplicative gates. It was evaluated on a multilabel scenario for genre classification of movies using the plot and the poster. The GMU improved the macro f-score performance of single-modality approaches and outperformed other fusion strategies, including mixture of experts models. Along with this work, the MM-IMDb dataset is released which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest publicly available multimodal dataset for genre prediction on movies.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 4, "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": 3, "comments": "The paper introduces Gated Multimodal Units GMUs, which use multiplicative weights to select the degree to which a hidden unit will consider different modalities in determining its activation.
