The proposed model explicitly represents \"sprites\" or its percepts inferred from maximum likelihood of the scene and infers its movement independently of its content. We impose architectural constraints that forces resulting architecture to behave as a recurrent what-where prediction network.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 3, "SUBSTANCE": 2, "comments": "This paper presents an approach to modeling videos based on a decomposition into a background + 2d sprites with a latent hidden state.
