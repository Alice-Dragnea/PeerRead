{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "A Context-aware Attention Network for Interactive Question Answering", "abstract": "We develop a new model for Interactive Question Answering (IQA), using Gated-Recurrent-Unit recurrent networks (GRUs) as encoders for statements and questions, and another GRU as a decoder for outputs. Distinct from previous work, our approach employs context-dependent word-level attention for more accurate statement representations and question-guided sentence-level attention for better context modeling. Employing these mechanisms, our model accurately understands when it can output an answer or when it requires generating a supplementary question for additional input. When available, user's feedback is encoded and directly applied to update sentence-level attention to infer the answer. Extensive experiments on QA and IQA datasets demonstrate quantitatively the effectiveness of our model with significant improvement over conventional QA models.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 3, "comments": "This work describes 1: a two stage encoding of stories in bAbI like setups, where a GRU is used to encode a sentence, word by word, conditioned on a sentence level GRU, and the sentence level GRU keep", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": 3, "ORIGINALITY": 2, "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "is_meta_review": false}, {"SUBSTANCE": 3, "comments": "This paper proposes an \"interactive\" version of the bAbI dataset by adding supporting questions/answers to the dataset in cases where there is not enough information to answer the question.
