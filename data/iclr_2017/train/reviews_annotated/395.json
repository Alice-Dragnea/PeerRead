{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Deep Probabilistic Programming", "abstract": "We propose Edward, a Turing-complete probabilistic programming language. Edward defines two compositional representations\u2014random variables and inference. By treating inference as a first class citizen, on a par with modeling, we show that probabilistic programming can be as flexible and computationally efficient as traditional deep learning. For flexibility, Edward makes it easy to fit the same model using a variety of composable inference methods, ranging from point estimation to variational inference to MCMC. In addition, Edward can reuse the modeling representation as part of inference, facilitating the design of rich variational models and generative adversarial networks. For efficiency, Edward is integrated into TensorFlow, providing significant speedups over existing probabilistic systems. For example, we show on a benchmark logistic regression task that Edward is at least 35x faster than Stan and 6x faster than PyMC3. Further, Edward incurs no runtime overhead: it is as fast as handwritten TensorFlow.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 4, "comments": "The authors propose a new software package for probabilistic programming, taking advantage of recent successful tools used in the deep learning community.
