{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Learning to Protect Communications with Adversarial Neural Cryptography", "abstract": "We ask whether neural networks can learn to use secret keys to protect information from other neural networks.  Specifically, we focus on ensuring confidentiality properties in a multiagent system, and we specify those properties in terms of an adversary.  Thus, a system may consist of neural networks named Alice and Bob, and we aim to limit what a third neural network named Eve learns from eavesdropping on the communication between Alice and Bob. We do not prescribe specific cryptographic algorithms to these neural networks; instead, we train end-to-end, adversarially. We demonstrate that the neural networks can learn  how to perform forms of encryption and decryption, and also how to apply these operations selectively in order to meet confidentiality goals.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 3, "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper proposed to use GAN for encrypted communications.
