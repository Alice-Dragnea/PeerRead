(2015) showed that pair-wise products of features in a convolutional network are a very effective representation of image textures. We propose a simple modification to that representation which makes it possible to incorporate long-range structure into image generation, and to render images that satisfy various symmetry constraints. We show how this can greatly improve rendering of regular textures and of images that contain other kinds of symmetric structure. We also present applications to inpainting and season transfer.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": false, "SUBSTANCE": 4, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper introduces a variation to the CNN-based texture synthesis procedure of Gatys et al. that matches correlations between spatially shifted feature responses in addition to the correlations betw", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": 5}, {"ORIGINALITY": 3, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper investigates a simple extension of Gatys et al.
