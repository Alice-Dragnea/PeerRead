{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Exploring the Application of Deep Learning for Supervised Learning Problems", "abstract": "One of the main difficulties in applying deep neural nets (DNNs) to new domains is the need to explore multiple architectures in order to discover ones that perform well. We analyze a large set of DNNs across multiple domains and derive insights regarding their effectiveness. We also analyze the characteristics of various DNNs and the general effect they may have on performance. Finally, we explore the application of meta-learning to the problem of architecture ranking. We demonstrate that by using topological features and modeling the changes in its weights, biases and activation functions layers of the initial training steps, we are able to rank architectures based on their predicted performance. We consider this work to be a first step in the important and challenging direction of exploring the space of different neural network architectures.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 3, "SUBSTANCE": 1, "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": 3, "comments": "This paper aims at attacking the problem of preselecting deep learning model structures for new domains.
