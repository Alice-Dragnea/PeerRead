{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Attend, Adapt and Transfer: Attentive Deep Architecture for Adaptive Transfer from multiple sources in the same domain", "abstract": "Transferring knowledge from prior source tasks in solving a new target task can be useful in several learning applications. The application of transfer poses two serious challenges which have not been adequately addressed. First, the agent should be able to avoid negative transfer, which happens when the transfer hampers or slows down the learning instead of helping it. Second, the agent should be able to selectively transfer, which is the ability to select and transfer from different and multiple source tasks for different parts of the state space of the target task. We propose A2T (Attend Adapt and Transfer), an attentive deep architecture which adapts and transfers from these source tasks. Our model is generic enough to effect transfer of either policies or value functions. Empirical evaluations on different learning algorithms show that A2T is an effective architecture for transfer by being able to avoid negative transfer while transferring selectively from multiple source tasks in the same domain.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"ORIGINALITY": 5, "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper studies the problem of transferring solutions of existing tasks to tackle a novel task under the framework of reinforcement learning and identifies two important issues of avoiding negative", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": 5}, {"is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper tackles important problems in multi-task reinforcement learning: avoid negative transfer and allow finer selective transfer.
