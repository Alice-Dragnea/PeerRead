{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Differentiable Canonical Correlation Analysis", "abstract": "Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) computes maximally-correlated  linear projections of two modalities. We propose Differentiable CCA, a  formulation of CCA that can be cast as a layer within a multi-view  neural network. Unlike Deep CCA, an earlier extension of CCA to  nonlinear projections, our formulation enables gradient flow through the  computation of the CCA projection matrices, and free choice of the final  optimization target. We show the effectiveness of this approach in  cross-modality retrieval experiments on two public image-to-text  datasets, surpassing both Deep CCA and a multi-view network with  freely-learned projections. We assume that Differentiable CCA could be a  useful building block for many multi-modality tasks.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 2, "ORIGINALITY": 2, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "It is not clear to me at all what this paper is contributing.
