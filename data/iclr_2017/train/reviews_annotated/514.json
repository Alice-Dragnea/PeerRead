{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Deep Learning with Sets and Point Clouds", "abstract": "We introduce a simple permutation equivariant layer for deep learning with set structure. This type of layer, obtained by parameter-sharing, has a simple implementation and linear-time complexity in the size of each set. We use deep permutation-invariant networks to perform point-could classification and MNIST digit summation, where in both cases the output is invariant to permutations of the input. In a semi-supervised setting, where the goal is make predictions for each instance within a set, we demonstrate the usefulness of this type of layer in set-outlier detection as well as semi-supervised learning with clustering side-information.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": false, "SUBSTANCE": 4, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "Pros : - New and clear formalism for invariance on signals with known structure - Good numerical results Cons : - The structure must be specified. - The set structure dataset is too simple - There is ", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": 4}, {"SUBSTANCE": 3, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper discusses ways to enforce invariance in neural networks using weight sharing.
