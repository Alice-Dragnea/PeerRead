{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Steganography", "abstract": "Steganography is collection of methods to hide secret information (\"payload\") within non-secret information (\"container\"). Its counterpart, Steganalysis, is the practice of determining if a message contains a hidden payload, and recovering it if possible. Presence of hidden payloads is typically detected by a binary classifier. In the present study, we propose a new model for generating image-like containers based on Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). This approach allows to generate more setganalysis-secure message embedding using standard steganography algorithms. Experiment results demonstrate that the new model successfully deceives the steganography analyzer, and for this reason, can be used in  steganographic applications.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"ORIGINALITY": 4, "SUBSTANCE": 4, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "I reviewed the manuscript as of December 6th.
