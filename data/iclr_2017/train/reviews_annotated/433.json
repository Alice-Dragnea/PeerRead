{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Density estimation using Real NVP", "abstract": "Unsupervised learning of probabilistic models is a central yet challenging problem in machine learning. Specifically, designing models with tractable learning, sampling, inference and evaluation is crucial in solving this task. We extend the space of such models using real-valued non-volume preserving (real NVP) transformations, a set of powerful invertible and learnable transformations, resulting in an unsupervised learning algorithm with exact log-likelihood computation, exact sampling, exact inference of latent variables, and an interpretable latent space. We demonstrate its ability to model natural images on four datasets through sampling, log-likelihood evaluation and latent variable manipulations.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"CLARITY": 5, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "Building on earlier work on a model called NICE, this paper presents an approach to constructing deep feed-forward generative models.
