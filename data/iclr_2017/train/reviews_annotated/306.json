{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Optimization as a Model for Few-Shot Learning", "abstract": "Though deep neural networks have shown great success in the large data domain, they generally perform poorly on few-shot learning tasks, where a model has to quickly generalize after seeing very few examples from each class. The general belief is that gradient-based optimization in high capacity models requires many iterative steps over many examples to perform well. Here, we propose an LSTM-based meta-learner model to learn the exact optimization algorithm used to train another learner neural network in the few-shot regime. The parametrization of our model allows it to learn appropriate parameter updates specifically for the scenario where a set amount of updates will be made, while also learning a general initialization of the learner network that allows for quick convergence of training. We demonstrate that this meta-learning model is competitive with deep metric-learning techniques for few-shot learning.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"SUBSTANCE": 4, "comments": "This paper describes a new approach to meta learning by interpreting the SGD update rule as gated recurrent model with trainable parameters.
