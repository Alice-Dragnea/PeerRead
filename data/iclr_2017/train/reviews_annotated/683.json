{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Boosted Residual Networks", "abstract": "In this paper we present a new ensemble method, called Boosted Residual Networks, which builds an ensemble of Residual Networks by growing the member network at each round of boosting. The proposed approach combines recent developements in Residual Networks - a method for creating very deep networks by including a shortcut layer between different groups of layers - with the Deep Incremental Boosting, which has been proposed as a methodology to train fast ensembles of networks of increasing depth through the use of boosting. We demonstrate that the synergy of Residual Networks and Deep Incremental Boosting has better potential than simply boosting a Residual Network of fixed structure or using the equivalent Deep Incremental Boosting without the shortcut layers.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 4, "SUBSTANCE": 4, "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": 1, "comments": "The paper under consideration proposes a set of procedures for incrementally expanding a residual network by adding layers via a boosting criterion.
