{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "An Information Retrieval Approach for Finding Dependent Subspaces of Multiple Views", "abstract": "Finding relationships between multiple views of data is essential both in exploratory analysis and as pre-processing for predictive tasks. A prominent approach is to apply variants of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), a classical method seeking correlated components between views. The basic CCA is restricted to maximizing a simple dependency criterion, correlation, measured directly between data coordinates. We introduce a new method that finds dependent subspaces of views directly optimized for the data analysis task of neighbor retrieval between multiple views. We optimize mappings for each view such as linear transformations to maximize cross-view similarity between neighborhoods of data samples. The criterion arises directly from the well-defined retrieval task, detects nonlinear and local similarities, measures dependency of data relationships rather than only individual data coordinates, and is related to well understood measures of information retrieval quality. In experiments the proposed method outperforms alternatives in preserving cross-view neighborhood similarities, and yields insights into local dependencies between multiple views.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": 3, "comments": "This paper proposes a multiview learning approach to finding dependent subspaces optimized for maximizing cross-view similarity between neighborhoods of data samples.
