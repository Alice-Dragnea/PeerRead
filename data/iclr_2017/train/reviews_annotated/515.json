{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Exponential Machines", "abstract": "Modeling interactions between features improves the performance of machine learning solutions in many domains (e.g. recommender systems or sentiment analysis). In this paper, we introduce Exponential Machines (ExM), a predictor that models all interactions of every order. The key idea is to represent an exponentially large tensor of parameters in a factorized format called Tensor Train (TT). The Tensor Train format regularizes the model and lets you control the number of underlying parameters. To train the model, we develop a stochastic Riemannian optimization procedure, which allows us to fit tensors with 2^160 entries. We show that the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic data with high-order interactions and that it works on par with high-order factorization machines on a recommender system dataset MovieLens 100K.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"comments": "The paper presents an application of a tensor factorization to linear models, which allows to consider higher-order interactions between variables in classification (and regression) problems, and that", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": 3, "ORIGINALITY": 4, "is_meta_review": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 3, "CLARITY": 5, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"SUBSTANCE": 3, "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": 4, "comments": "The paper describes how to use a tensor factorization method called Tensor Train for modeling the interactions between features for supervised classification tasks.
