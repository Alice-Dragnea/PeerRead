{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "On the Quantitative Analysis of Decoder-Based Generative Models", "abstract": "The past several years have seen remarkable progress in generative models which produce convincing samples of images and other modalities. A shared component of some popular models such as generative adversarial networks and generative moment matching networks, is a decoder network, a parametric deep neural net that defines a generative distribution. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to quantify the performance of these models because of the intractability of log-likelihood estimation, and inspecting samples can be misleading. We propose to use Annealed Importance Sampling for evaluating log-likelihoods for decoder-based models and validate its accuracy using bidirectional Monte Carlo. Using this technique, we analyze the performance of decoder-based models, the effectiveness of existing log-likelihood estimators, the degree of overfitting, and the degree to which these models miss important modes of the data distribution.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"CLARITY": 3, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper describes a method to evaluate generative models such as VAE, GAN and GMMN.
