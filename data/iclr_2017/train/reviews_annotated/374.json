Fine-grained Gating for Reading Comprehension", "abstract": "Previous work combines word-level and character-level representations using concatenation or scalar weighting, which is suboptimal for high-level tasks like reading comprehension. We present a fine-grained gating mechanism to dynamically combine word-level and character-level representations based on properties of the words. We also extend the idea of fine-grained gating to modeling the interaction between questions and paragraphs for reading comprehension. Experiments show that our approach can improve the performance on reading comprehension tasks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the Children's Book Test and Who Did What datasets. To demonstrate the generality of our gating mechanism, we also show improved results on a social media tag prediction task.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"ORIGINALITY": 4, "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "I think the problem here is well motivated, the approach is insightful and intuitive, and the results are convincing of the approach (although lacking in variety of applications).
