{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Towards Deep Interpretability (MUS-ROVER II): Learning Hierarchical Representations of Tonal Music", "abstract": "Music theory studies the regularity of patterns in music to capture concepts underlying music styles and composers' decisions. This paper continues the study of building \\emph{automatic theorists} (rovers) to learn and represent music concepts that lead to human interpretable knowledge and further lead to materials for educating people. Our previous work took a first step in algorithmic concept learning of tonal music, studying high-level representations (concepts) of symbolic music (scores) and extracting interpretable rules for composition. This paper further studies the representation \\emph{hierarchy} through the learning process, and supports \\emph{adaptive} 2D memory selection in the resulting language model. This leads to a deeper-level interpretability that expands from individual rules to a dynamic system of rules, making the entire rule learning process more cognitive. The outcome is a new rover, MUS-ROVER \\RN{2}, trained on Bach's chorales, which outputs customizable syllabi for learning compositional rules. We demonstrate comparable results to our music pedagogy, while also presenting the differences and variations. In addition, we point out the rover's potential usages in style recognition and synthesis, as well as applications beyond music.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"APPROPRIATENESS": 2, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "After the discussion below, I looked at previous work by the authors (MUS-ROVER) on which this paper was based.
