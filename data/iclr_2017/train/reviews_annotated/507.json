{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Automated Generation of Multilingual Clusters for the Evaluation of Distributed Representations", "abstract": "We propose a language-agnostic way of automatically generating sets of semantically similar clusters of entities along with sets of \"outlier\" elements, which may then be used to perform an intrinsic evaluation of word embeddings in the outlier detection task. We used our methodology to create a gold-standard dataset, which we call WikiSem500, and evaluated multiple state-of-the-art embeddings. The results show a correlation between performance on this dataset and performance on sentiment analysis.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 4, "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": 3, "comments": "This paper introduces a new dataset to evaluate word representations.
