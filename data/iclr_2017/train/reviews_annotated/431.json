{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Paleo: A Performance Model for Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "Although various scalable deep learning software packages have been proposed, it remains unclear how to best leverage parallel and distributed computing infrastructure to accelerate their training and deployment. Moreover, the effectiveness of existing parallel and distributed systems varies widely based on the neural network architecture and dataset under consideration.  In order to efficiently explore the space of scalable deep learning systems and quickly diagnose their effectiveness for a given problem instance, we introduce an analytical performance model called Paleo. Our key observation is that a neural network architecture carries with it a declarative specification of the computational requirements associated with its training and evaluation. By extracting these requirements from a given architecture and mapping them to a specific point within the design space of software, hardware and communication strategies, Paleo can efficiently and accurately model the expected scalability and performance of a putative deep learning system.  We show that Paleo is robust to the choice of network architecture, hardware, software, communication schemes, and parallelization strategies. We further demonstrate its ability to accurately model various recently published scalability results for CNNs such as NiN, Inception and AlexNet.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": false, "SUBSTANCE": 3, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "In PALEO the authors propose a simple model of execution of deep neural networks.
