{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Learning a Static Analyzer: A Case Study on a Toy Language", "abstract": "Static analyzers are meta-programs that analyze programs to detect   potential errors or collect information. For example, they are used   as security tools to detect potential buffer overflows. Also, they   are used by compilers to verify that a program is well-formed and   collect information to generate better code. In this paper, we   address the following question: can a static analyzer be learned   from data? More specifically, can we use deep learning to learn a   static analyzer without the need for complicated feature   engineering? We show that long short-term memory networks are able   to learn a basic static analyzer for a simple toy language. However,   pre-existing approaches based on feature engineering, hidden Markov   models, or basic recurrent neural networks fail on such a simple   problem. Finally, we show how to make such a tool usable by   employing a language model to help the programmer detect where the   reported errors are located.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 2, "SUBSTANCE": 1, "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": 2, "comments": "The authors explore the idea of deep-learning a static analyzer.
