{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Energy-based Generative Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "We introduce the \"Energy-based Generative Adversarial Network\" model (EBGAN) which views the discriminator as an energy function that attributes low energies to the regions near the data manifold and higher energies to other regions. Similar to the probabilistic GANs, a generator is seen as being trained to produce contrastive samples with minimal energies, while the discriminator is trained to assign high energies to these generated samples. Viewing the discriminator as an energy function allows to use a wide variety of architectures and loss functionals in addition to the usual binary classifier with logistic output. Among them, we show one instantiation of EBGAN framework as using an auto-encoder architecture, with the energy being the reconstruction error, in place of the discriminator. We show that this form of EBGAN exhibits more stable behavior than regular GANs during training. We also show that a single-scale architecture can be trained to generate high-resolution images.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IMPACT": 5, "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper introduces an energy-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and provides theoretical and empirical results modeling a number of image datasets (including large-scale versions of categor", "RECOMMENDATION": 5}, {"IMPACT": 4, "comments": "This paper proposes a novel extension of generative adversarial networks that replaces the traditional binary classifier discriminator with one that assigns a scalar energy to each point in the genera", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": 5, "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "CLARITY": 5, "is_meta_review": false}, {"IS_META_REVIEW": false, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching.
