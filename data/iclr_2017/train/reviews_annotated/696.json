{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Emergent Predication Structure in Vector Representations of Neural Readers", "abstract": "Reading comprehension is a question answering task where the answer is to be found in a given passage about entities and events not mentioned in general knowledge sources. A significant number of neural architectures for this task (neural readers) have recently been developed and evaluated on large cloze-style datasets. We present experiments supporting the emergence of \u201cpredication structure\u201d in the hidden state vectors of a class of neural readers including the Attentive Reader and Stanford Reader. We posits that the hidden state vectors can be viewed as (a representation of) a concatenation [P, c] of a \u201cpredicate vector\u201d P and a \u201cconstant symbol vector\u201d c and that the hidden state represents the atomic formula P(c). This predication structure plays a conceptual role in relating \u201caggregation readers\u201d such as the Attentive Reader and the Stanford Reader to \u201cexplicit reference readers\u201d such as the Attention-Sum Reader, the Gated-Attention Reader and the Attention-over-Attention Reader. In an independent contribution, we show that the addition of linguistics features to the input to existing neural readers significantly boosts performance yielding the best results to date on the Who-did-What dataset.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"ORIGINALITY": 3, "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper proposed to analyze several recently developed machine readers and found that some machine readers could potentially take advantages of the entity marker (given that the same marker points o", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": 5}, {"IS_META_REVIEW": false, "CLARITY": 4, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper aims to consolidate some recent literature in simple types of \"reading comprehension\" tasks involving matching questions to answers to be found in a passage, and then to explore the types of", "APPROPRIATENESS": 2}, {"CLARITY": 5, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper aims to provide an insightful and analytic survey over the recent literature on reading comprehension with the distinct goal of investigating whether logical structure (or predication, as t", "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "authors": "Hai Wang, Takeshi Onishi, Kevin Gimpel, David McAllester", "accepted": false, "id": "696"}
