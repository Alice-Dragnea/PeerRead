{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Deep Character-Level Neural Machine Translation By Learning Morphology", "abstract": "Neural machine translation aims at building a single large neural network that can be trained to maximize translation performance. The encoder-decoder architecture with an attention mechanism achieves a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based systems. However, the use of large vocabulary becomes the bottleneck in both training and improving the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture which learns morphology by using two recurrent networks and a hierarchical decoder which translates at character level. This gives rise to a deep character-level model consisting of six recurrent networks. Such a deep model has two major advantages. It avoids the large vocabulary issue radically; at the same time, it is more efficient in training than word-based models. Our model obtains a higher BLEU score than the bpe-based model after training for one epoch on En-Fr and En-Cs translation tasks. Further analyses show that our model is able to learn morphology.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": 5, "comments": "Update after reading the authors' responses & the paper revision dated Dec 21: I have removed the comment \"insufficient comparison to past work\" in the title & update the score from 3 -> 5.
