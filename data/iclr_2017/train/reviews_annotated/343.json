{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Program Synthesis for Character Level Language Modeling", "abstract": "We propose a statistical model applicable to character level language modeling and show that it is a good fit for both, program source code and English text. The model is parameterized by a program from a domain-specific language (DSL) that allows expressing non-trivial data dependencies. Learning is done in two phases: (i) we synthesize a program from the DSL, essentially learning a good representation for the data, and (ii) we learn parameters from the training data - the process is done via counting, as in simple language models such as n-gram.  Our experiments show that the precision of our model is comparable to that of neural networks while sharing a number of advantages with n-gram models such as fast query time and the capability to quickly add and remove training data samples. Further, the model is parameterized by a program that can be manually inspected, understood and updated, addressing a major problem of neural networks.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": false, "CLARITY": 3, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper proposes an approach to character language modeling (CLMs) based on developing a domain specific language to represent CLMs. The experiments show mixed performance versus neural CLM approac", "APPROPRIATENESS": 2}, {"SUBSTANCE": 4, "comments": "This paper introduces a novel method for language modeling which is suitable for both modeling programming language as well as natural language.
