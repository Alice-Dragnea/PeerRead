{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Hyperband: Bandit-Based Configuration Evaluation for Hyperparameter Optimization", "abstract": "Performance of machine learning algorithms depends critically on identifying a good set of hyperparameters.  While recent approaches use Bayesian Optimization to adaptively select configurations, we focus on speeding up random search through adaptive resource allocation.  We present Hyperband,  a novel algorithm for hyperparameter optimization that is simple, flexible, and theoretically sound.  Hyperband is a principled early-stoppping method that adaptively allocates a predefined resource, e.g., iterations, data samples or number of features, to randomly sampled configurations.  We compare Hyperband with state-of-the-art Bayesian Optimization methods on several hyperparameter optimization problems.  We observe that Hyperband can provide over an order of magnitude speedups over competitors on a variety of neural network and kernel-based learning problems.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": false, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper discusses Hyperband, an extension of successive halving by Jamieson & Talwalkar (AISTATS 2016).
