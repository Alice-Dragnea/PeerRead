{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Layer Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Layer-RNN (L-RNN) module that is able to learn contextual information adaptively using within-layer recurrence. Our contributions are three-fold:  (i) we propose a hybrid neural network architecture that interleaves traditional convolutional layers with L-RNN module for learning long- range dependencies at multiple levels;  (ii) we show that a L-RNN module can be seamlessly inserted into any convolutional layer of a pre-trained CNN, and the entire network then fine-tuned, leading to a boost in performance;  (iii) we report experiments on the CIFAR-10 classification task, showing that a network with interleaved convolutional layers and L-RNN modules, achieves comparable results (5.39% top1 error) using only 15 layers and fewer parameters to ResNet-164 (5.46%); and on the PASCAL VOC2012 semantic segmentation task, we show that the performance of a pre-trained FCN network can be boosted by 5% (mean IOU) by simply inserting Layer-RNNs.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": false, "CLARITY": 5, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper proposes a cascade of paired (left/right, up/down) 1D RNNs as a module in CNNs in order to quickly add global context information to features without the need for stacking many convolutiona", "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": 3}, {"ORIGINALITY": 2, "CLARITY": 5, "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper proposes a method of integrating recurrent layers within larger, potentially pre-trained, convolutional networks.
